        Thank you for listening to my song. My name is Leala Hailey, and I created this for a final project. Admittedly, I was very excited to work on it, but the lack of proper equipment limited my ability to produce a polished song and keep my voice on beat. I apologize for any inconsistencies. I sampled sounds from FreeSound by an artist going under the name Acclivity. Shout out to my professor, Barba Masters, for being such a patient and supportive teacher—she took the time to answer questions and guide the class through new concepts. I definitely learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses in this class. Hopefully, one day the world will hear something even better from me.
