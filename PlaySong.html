Thank you for listening to my song. My name is Leala Hailey, and I created this piece as part of my final project for class. The assignment was to produce an original audio project, which meant learning how to record, edit, and assemble sound in a meaningful way. I used a combination of my own vocals and audio samples from FreeSound, specifically from an artist named Acclivity. Even though I was excited to create it, I didn’t have access to professional recording equipment, which made it challenging to keep everything perfectly in rhythm and as polished as I hoped. Because of that, there may be moments where the timing or quality is not exactly ideal.

Despite those challenges, this project helped me learn a lot about sound design, creative problem solving, and my own strengths and weaknesses as a creator. It also gave me the chance to experiment, take risks, and express myself in a new way. I’m grateful to my professor, Barba Masters, for being incredibly patient and supportive throughout the process, always guiding the class through unfamiliar tools and concepts. This project was both a learning experience and a beginning, and I hope that in the future I’ll be able to create something even stronger and more refined    </p>
